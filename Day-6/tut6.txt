Types of Middelware

1) Application Levwl Middleware  ---- app.use(m1)
const m1 = (req , res , next) => {
}
2) Router Level Middleware
3) Built In Middleware
Express.json()
static  -- Normal HTML files are avialble in which folder

4) Third Party Middleware
CORS error = When we get an error in connecting Frontend and Backend
CORS is used to use the functioning of other application by the use of API 
Morgan/Wingston = Morgan is  used to store the logs in our Day to Day Working

5) Error Handling Middleware 
Robust = it should always correct and does not give any error
const m2 = (error , req , res , next) => {
    res.status(500).send("Internal Server Error)    // 500 Error is used when we don't know which error will be came
}
It should be applied at last after all the Routing
